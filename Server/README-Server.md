This folder contains all the code for the server side of the project. 
This includes the frontend using React and Chakra which was choosen for it's ease of use with simple premade elements.
The backend utilizes Flask, choosen for it's ability to handle http requests while being compatible with DeepFace python library.
The DB is hosted on MongoDB since a NoSQL database made more sense considering we didn't want to have limits on scability

Overall, the code works well for demonstration purposes but further testing and improvement could be done for scalability especially when handling multiple requests from different locks.
