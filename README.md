## Product Description
This smart lock uses facial recognition and speech-to-text with a companion web app to control and monitor the lock from anywhere with internet connection. When it sees unrecognized visitors approach, it will shut and begin recording a voice memo, else it will open.

The frontend allows logged-in users to remotely lock/unlock the door and to view its open/closed status. It also describes our product and shows all visitor faces and transcriptions of voice memos taken from the Rpi. Users can adajust their settings and manage resident faces that the door should unlock for.

## Product Features
Automatic and remote locking, activity logging and alert, face recognition-based unlocking, message deposit feature for unfamilar visitors, active lock-status retrival, and stress-free installation.

## Set Up
Consult the READMEs and Setup files in the rpi/, Server/, and Server/frontend to set up the RPi, server, and frontend respectively.
